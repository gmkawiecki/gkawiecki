SUMMARY

The document "Development_of_Efficient_Vertical_Axis_Wind_Turbines" presents the result of a comparative experimental study of two basic Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) configurations: a classical one with fixed blade pitch and a novel configuration with passive blade pitch control using a linkage mechanism with a center of rotation eccentric with respect to turbine’s vertical axis (Benedict and Chopra, 2016; Erickson et al, 2011). To the best of my knowledge, this is is the first study to compare experimentally both configurations, using the same basic test specimen. I carried out this work in my garage during the pandemic lockdown.

Conclusions

Obtained results indicate that the variable blade pitch configuration of a VAWT offers far superior performance for low and moderate wind velocities and for low load resistance values.  Those are precisely the typical conditions for urban and residential environments and applications of growing interest, such as car or renewable energy production system batteries.
